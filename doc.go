/*
gogramps is a library for interacting with Gramps, an open-source genealogical
program. It is a work in progress.

The library is currently focused on Gramps XML (.gramps) files. It allows them
to be parsed and exposes Go structs representing the files.  The structs can
then be modified and serialized back into a valid file.

For more information on Gramps, visit gramps-project.org.
